# Object Impact Framework

**Object Impact Framework (OIF)** is a SKSE plugin that lets you add custom effects to items upon **activation**, **grabbing**, **releasing**, **throwing**, **hitting**, **update**, or **weather change**. You can make things happen like spawning or swapping items and actors, casting spells, creating various visual effects, playing sounds, and more - all controlled with JSON files. Compatible with everything.

This guide explains how to set up those JSON files so you can create your own mods. Examples are given at the end of the documentation.

## Users Info

- Place your JSON files in: `Data/SKSE/Plugins/ObjectImpactFramework/`

## Mod Authors Info

- **Filter Note**: An object must be defined by at least one of the three parameters - `formIDs`, `editorIDs`, `formLists`, `formTypes`, `keywords` - for the event to work. **Warning:** Equivalents with the `Not` ending do *not* count.
- **Effect Additional Fields Note**: Make sure you check whether the effect requires the presence of the `items` field. Without specifying and filling out this field (at least with one identifier or, if the effect does not support identifiers, with any available field), the effect will *not* work.
- **Priority Note**: Place effects with `"Remove"` and `"Swap"` prefixes at the very end of the event, otherwise the removed object may not have time to call other effects on itself before gets deleted.
- **Non-Collidable Objects Note**: By default, the framework can detect non-collidable objects, but this does not apply to the `Hit` event. Only `flora` and `tree` hits are supported. Since the system uses workarounds and mathematical calculations, it can cause plants location estimate not to be always accurate. **Warning:** Spells with attached projectiles are currently not supported due to the hooks issues.
- **Troubleshooting Note**: If something doesn't work, look at the mod's log file for error messages. The log can be found in `Documents/My Games/Skyrim Special Edition/SKSE/ObjectImpactFramework.log`
- You can modify existing JSON files without quitting the game, edit the file and reload the save.

## Basic Rule Structure

Each rule in your JSON file defines a specific behavior for the mod. Rules are written as an array of objects, where each object contains three main fields: `event`, `filter`, and `effect`. Here's what each field does:

- **`event`**: Specifies the trigger(s) for the rule. This is an array of strings, allowing multiple events to trigger the same rule. Valid values are:
  - `"Activate"`: Triggered when an object is activated (e.g., opened, used).
  - `"Hit"`: Triggered when an object is hit by a weapon, spell, or projectile.
  - `"Grab"`: Triggered when an object is picked up by the player.
  - `"Release"`: Triggered when a grabbed object is dropped.
  - `"Telekinesis"`: Triggered when an object the player was holding with telekinesis lands.
  - `"Throw"`: Triggered when a grabbed object is thrown (requires the **Grab And Throw** mod by powerofthree).
  - `"CellAttach"`: Triggered when an object is attached to a cell (works on location re-enter as well).
  - `"CellDetach"`: Triggered when an object is detached from a cell.
  - `"WeatherChange"`: Triggered on weather change.
  - `"OnUpdate"`: Triggered every 1 second.
  - `"DestructionStageChange"`: Triggered on object's destruction stage change. The effect will *not* be applied to the scene when the object is disabled or deleted.
  
- **`filter`**: Defines the targeted objects and the conditions under which a rule applies to them. At least one of `formTypes`, `formIDs`, `editorIDs`, `formLists`, or `keywords` must be provided to identify target objects.

- **`effect`**: Describes what happens when the rule is triggered. Each effect has a `type` and, for most types, an `items` array specifying what to spawn, swap, or apply.

Here's a basic example of a rule:

```json
[
    {
        "event": ["Activate", "Hit"],
        "filter": {
            "formTypes": ["activator"]
        },
        "effect": [{
            "type": "SpawnItem",
            "items": [{"formID": "Skyrim.esm:0xF"}]
        }]
    }
]
```

This rule triggers when an activator (e.g., a lever) is activated or hit, spawning a single gold coin (`Skyrim.esm:0xF`).

---

## Filters: Choosing Which Objects to Affect and How

The `filter` object determines which objects and interactions trigger a rule. It's highly customizable, allowing precise control over when effects occur.

Below are all possible filter parameters:

### General Filters

- **`formTypes`** (one of the required fields to choose from): An array of strings specifying the types of objects the rule applies to. Possible values:
  - `"activator"`: Standard activators (e.g., levers, buttons).
  - `"talkingactivator"`: Activators that can "speak" (e.g., some quest-related objects).
  - `"weapon"`: Weapons like swords or bows (lying around in the world).
  - `"armor"`: Armor pieces.
  - `"ammo"`: Ammunition (e.g., arrows, bolts).
  - `"ingredient"`: Alchemy ingredients.
  - `"misc"`: Miscellaneous items (e.g., clutter, tools).
  - `"key"`: Keys.
  - `"book"`: Books and journals.
  - `"note"`: Notes.
  - `"scroll"`: Magical scrolls.
  - `"soulgem"`: Soul gems.
  - `"potion"`: Includes potions, poisons, food, and drinks.
  - `"furniture"`: Furniture like chairs or beds.
  - `"door"`: Doors and gates.
  - `"flora"`: Harvestable plants and hanging animals.
  - `"container"`: Containers like chests or barrels.
  - `"static"`: Static objects (e.g., statues).
  - `"moveablestatic"`: Movable static objects.
  - `"tree"`: Trees.
  - `"light"`: Lights with 3D models (e.g., torches).
 
- **`formTypesNot`**: An array of strings specifying the types of objects that the rule should *not* apply to. Same format as `formTypes`.

- **`formIDs`** (one of the required fields to choose from): An array of strings identifying specific objects by their formID in the format `"modName:formID"`. Examples:
  - `"Skyrim.esm:0x123456"` (for esp/esm plugins).
  - `"MyMod.esl:0x456"` (for esl/espfe plugins).
  - `"Dawnguard.esm:00123456"` (alternate format with leading zeros (esp/esm)).
  - `"MyMod.esp:FE000800"` (alternate format with leading FE prefix (esl/espfe)).

- **`formIDsNot`**: An array of strings identifying specific objects that the rule should *not* apply to. Same format as `formIDs`.

- **`editorIDs`** (one of the required fields to choose from): An array of strings identifying specific objects by their editorID in the format `"EditorIDName"`. Example: `"VendorItemClutter"`.

- **`editorIDsNot`**: An array of strings identifying specific objects that the rule should *not* apply to. Same format as `editorIDs`.

- **`formLists`** (one of the required fields to choose from): An array of objects referencing formlists. Each entry has:
  - **`formID`**: The formlist's form ID in `"modName:formID"` format (use this or `editorID`).
  - **`editorID`**: The formlist's editor ID in `"EditorIDName"` format (use this or `formID`).
  - **`index`** (optional): An integer specifying which item in the formlist to use. Example:
 
    ```json

        {"formID": "Skyrim.esm:0x123456", "index": 0},
        {"editorID": "ExampleFormList"}
    ]
    ```
    - **Index `-1`** is default, means that all the items at once will be used. 
    - **Index `-2`** defines the parrallel relationship for mirrored formlists: matching positions between `filter` and effects' `items` formlists correspond directly, allowing ordered transformations (e.g., raw meat at position 0 in formlist 1 becomes cooked meat at position 0 in formlist 2).

- **`formListsNot`**: An array of formlist objects that the rule should *not* apply to. Same format as `formLists`.

- **`keywords`** (one of the required fields to choose from): An array of keywords or formists of keywords that the object must have. Format: `"modName:formID"` (e.g., `"Skyrim.esm:0xABCDEF"`), `"EditorIDName"` (e.g., `"VendorItemFood"`), or a formlist's formID/editorID.

- **`keywordsNot`**: An array of keywords or formists of keyword the object must *not* have. Same format as `keywords`.

- **`chance`**: A number between 0 and 100 representing the percentage chance the rule triggers (e.g., `"chance": 90.0`). Defaults to `100`.

  - **`min`**: Minimal random value.
  - **`max`**: Maximal random value.

- **`limit`**: An integer setting the maximum number of interactions per object (e.g., `"limit": 5`). Defaults to `0` - no limit.

  **Optional** detailed entry (e.g., `"limit": {"min": 0, "max": 10}`):
  - **`min`**: Minimal random value.
  - **`max`**: Maximal random value.

- **`questItemStatus`**: An integer specifying quest item status requirements. Only works with **ACTIVE** player quests:
  - `0` (default): Not a quest item.
  - `1`: Quest alias only.
  - `2`: A full-fledged quest item.
  - `3`: All allowed.
 
- **`isInitiallyDisabled`**: An integer specifying whether the object has the `kInitiallyDisabled` flag.
  - `0`: Not initially disabled.

   - `0`: Does not have an Enable Parent.
   - `1`: Has an Enable Parent.
   - `2` (default): All allowed.

   This is useful for excluding objects that are controlled by another reference, such as hidden fire/light references used by some objects (for example, Khajiit caravan fires).

   Example: affect only fire/light references that are **not** controlled by an Enable Parent:

   ```json
   {
       "event": ["WeatherChange"],
       "filter": {
           "formTypes": ["light"],
           "isParented": 0
       },
       "effect": [
           {
               "type": "DisableItem"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```
 - **`isOwned`**: An integer specifying whether the object reference has an owner assigned. `0` = no owner (excluding player owned), `1` = has an owner, `2` = ignore ownership. (default)
 
 - **Spawn/swap ownership**: Pickable inventory items created by OIF clear ownership when the source reference is unowned inside an interior cell. If the source already has an NPC/faction/etc. owner, that ownership is preserved. Non-pickable world objects such as Activators and Movable Statics are not modified by this ownership cleanup.

  - Supported fields: `string`, `chance`, `timer`.

- **`ShowNotification`**: Shows a notification.
  - Supported fields: `string`, `chance`, `timer`.

- **`ShowMessageBox`**: Shows a message box with "OK" button.

### Configuring Effects with `items`

For effect types that support an `items` array, you can specify detailed configurations. Each item in the array can include:

- **`formID`**: A specific formID in `"modName:formID"` format (e.g., `"Skyrim.esm:0xF"` for a gold coin).

- **`editorID`**: A specific editorID in `"EditorIDName` format (e.g., `"VendorItemClutter"` for clutter).

- **`formList`**: An array of formlist entries.
  - **`formID`**: The formlist's formID in `"modName:formID"` format (use this or `editorID`).
  - **`editorID`**: The formlist's editorID in `"EditorIDName"` format (use this or `formID`).
  - **`index`** (optional): An integer specifying which item in the formlist to use:
    - `-1` (default): All items at once.
    - `-2`: Parallel relationship for mirrored formlists.
    - `-3`: Select one random object from the list.
    - Other values: Specific index in the formlist.
    
    Example:
    ```json
    "formList": [
        {"formID": "Skyrim.esm:0x123456", "index": 0},
        {"formID": "MyMod.esp:0x789ABC", "index": -3}
    ]
    ```

- **`chance`**: A number between 0 and 100 for the percentage chance this item is used (e.g., `"chance": 90.0`). Defaults to `100`. 

  **Optional** detailed entry (e.g., `"chance": {"min": 0.1, "max": 85.0}`):
  - **`min`**: Minimal random value.
  - **`max`**: Maximal random value.

- **`timer`**: A defined number of seconds before triggering the effect (e.g., `"timer": 1.0`). **Optional** detailed entry has:
  - **`time`**: Number of seconds. (e.g., `"timer": {"time": 1.0}`).

    **Optional** detailed entry (e.g., `"timer": {"time": {"min": 1.0, "max": 10.0}}`):
    - **`min`**: Minimal random value.
    - **`max`**: Maximal random value.
  - **`matchFilterRecheck`**: Whether the effect needs to be canceled if conditions were violated while waiting.
    - `0`: No re-check.
    - `1`: Re-check.

    ```json
    "timer": {"time": 1.0, "matchFilterRecheck": 1}
    ```

- **`count`**: An integer specifying how many instances to spawn or how many times to perform a particular action (e.g., `"count": 2`). Defaults to `1`. 

  **Optional** detailed entry (e.g., `"count": {"min": 1, "max": 5}`):
  - **`min`**: Minimal random value.
  - **`max`**: Maximal random value.

- **`radius`**: Specifies the radius in game units for effect application (e.g., `"radius": 100.0`). Defaults to `100.0`. 

  **Optional** detailed entry (e.g., `"radius": {"min": 50.0, "max": 150.0}`):
  - **`min`**: Minimal random value.
  - **`max`**: Maximal random value.
 
- **`scale`**: Used for `spawn`/`swap` functions only. Allows to select the scale of a spawned item (e.g., `"scale": 2.0`). By default, it is copied from the target object.

  **Optional** detailed entry (e.g., `"scale": {"min": 1.5, "max": 3.0}`):
  - **`min`**: Minimal random value.
  - **`max`**: Maximal random value.

- **`duration`**: For `PlayIdle`, defaults to 1.0 (lower values make animation faster). For **effect shaders** and **art objects**, specifies how long the effect lasts.

- **`string`**: Used for various effects. Takes one entry. For **spawn** and **swap** effects, used to take node name. For `PlayIdle`, used to take animation name.

- **`strings`**: Used for various effects. Takes multiple entries. For `ToggleNode`, used to take multiple node names.

- **`mode`**: Used for various effects. Currently used for `ToggleNode` effect to specify the disable or enable mode.
  - `0` (default): Disable.
  - `1`: Enable.
 
- **`nonDeletable`**: Used for `swap` functions only. During swap, the original object is deactivated and a new one appears in its place. This value determines whether the original object is deleted (`0`) or only disabled (`1`).

- **`fade`**: Used for `spawn`/`swap` functions only. Determines whether the object will have a fade effect upon creation:
  - `0`: Without fade effect (do **not** use with **explosions**).
  - `1` (default): With fade effect.

- **`spawnType`**: Used for `spawn`/`swap` functions only. Allows you to select the type of how the object should be spawned. Options:
  - `0`: Common PlaceAtMe().
  - `1`: PlaceAtMe() spawning the object at the center of the original.
  - `2`: PlaceAtMe() spawning at the top of the original.
  - `3`: PlaceAtMe() spawning at the bottom of the original.
  - `4` (default): Common PlaceAtMe() with buggy engine physics bypassing (e.g., when used with `Throw`/`Grab`/`Release`, the object will be spawned exactly to the landing point without position glitches).
  - `5`: Bypass with spawning the object at the center of the original.
  - `6`: Bypass with spawning at the top of the original.
  - `7`: Bypass with spawning at the bottom of the original.
  - `8`: Pin to the ground regardless of the landing location (e.g., when used with `Throw`, an object that lands on the wall will spawn a new one directly beneath it on the floor).
  - `9`: Pin to the specified node. Requires a node name or it's substring to be passed in `string`.

  **NOTE**: If you want to spawn **explosions**, use `0` or `4` only.
